# SDL "Game" made in C

### About
This "game" is written in C with the usage of few SDL libraries (SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf). It isn't anything special, I just made it to test what I can (and can't) do now in C. It doesn't have any plot, any special gameplay (as of now).

### Installation
For the "game" to properly work first download needed SDL libraries (SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf) and pass their path to the INCLUDE_PATHS and LIBRARY_PATHS in Makefile file. Remember to also add their binaries (.dll if on windows) to the Path of the environmental variables (I'm not sure how this looks on Linux, haven't tested this yet).

_Note: In the case anyone wondered where is SDL_image and SDL_ttf included I want to mention that I added SDL_image and SDL_ttf files (include and lib) to the main SDL2 folder and just included/linked it all together_

Then compile everything with Makefile.

### Note
Somebody may ask "why do you write "game" in quotation marks?" - I do not think anything this "thing" I create/created here can be called a game and it's just my personal opinion.

### State
I'm still working on it and I won't probably finish it, but who knows.
